# Dog-Cat-Predection-using-neural-networks

This project Included in Freecodecamp Machine Learning with Python Certification present creating a Dog/Cats Classifier using

## Project Instructions

In this challenge, the project goal is to complete the code to classify images of dogs and cats,using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural 
network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.
